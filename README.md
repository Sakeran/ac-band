## Spring 2021 Web Development Challenge - Album Landing Page

This is the sixth project in my [Spring 2021 - Web Development Challenge](https://10in30.alexander-morse.com/) series, where I am attempting to design, code, and ship ten different web projects in the space of one month, under a variety of constraints.

This was a front-end design challenge, using Sass as a CSS preprocessor and a small amount of Javascript animation, but very little else. It used Parcel.js for its development and build environments.

A live version of this project can be found running [here](https://arm-ac-band.surge.sh/).

Here I gave myself something a little more fun to work on - a promotional landing page for some fictional band’s new album. I ended up using Parcel again for my development and build environment, though this time I used Sass for my stylesheet preprocessing, and I ended up migrating to V2 toward the end of the process due to build errors. To deal with the project’s image-reliant design, I also spent some time learning how to work with the .webp image format - and now that I’ve seen the difference it makes, I realize that I _should_ have been using these all along.

Similarly to the desserts blog I did earlier, I feel like I failed the design I started out with, though I’m starting to get a feel for why that is. I can capture the look and feel of a design in CSS fairly easily at this point, but I’m falling short on implementing layouts in a few ways. While I don’t really have the space to expound on those here, I will try to improve on them when I’m implementing more “ambitious” designs like these ones.
